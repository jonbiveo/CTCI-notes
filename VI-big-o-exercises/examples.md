## 1

Two for loops. First one loops through array and adds every element to sum. Second loops through array again and multiplies product by each element.

O(n) because it iterates through array twice which is 0(2n) but we drop the constants, so 0(n).

## 2

A nested for loop printing each pair of elements.

0(n^2) because for every element, it loops through array again and prints the pair.

## 3

[1,2,3,4]

1,2
1,3
1,4
2,3
2,4
3,4

The total work is n^2 * 1/2, but we drop constants so 0(n^2).

Time complexity is focused on describing the worst case runtime of the function.

We drop the constants because it doesn't pertain to the worst case runtime of the function. Every time we call the function, it will always have that constant, so it doesn't matter. It doesn't affect our understanding of the worst case runtime, every runtime will have that constant.

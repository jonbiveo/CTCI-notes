Introduction
	- no section title
		- walked out of interview frustrated they were rejecting all ten candidates including a former student of his
		- he was a great candidate with great experience/college, but too many red flags
		- struggled to solve the problems
		- trouble developing algo
		- failed to consider solutions that optimized for other scenarios
		- code was riddled with mistakes
		- he read K&Rs classic C book and reviewed CLRS's famous algo textbook
		- these books arent enough
		- they prepare you for research and probably help be a SWE, but theyre not sufficient for interview problems
		- need to prepare with real interview questions, practice real problems, and learn their patterns
		- its all about developing a fresh algo, not memorizing existing ones
		- this book is from the authors personal experience, the result of hundreds of interviews, first hand interviews, and thousands of outside contributions
	- my approach
		- focusing on specific tech questions like "what is a virtual function?" limits yourself to one very specific bit of knowledge
		- the questions in this book look to broaden your view and learn the patterns and skills necessary to solve problems on your own and develop a fresh algo
	- My passion
		- author loves teaching, helping people understand new concepts, and giving them tools to excel in their passion
		- first experience teaching was University of Pennsylvania TA during second year.
		- TA'd several other classes, and started own CS course there focused on hands on skills
		- Cracking the coding interview, cracking the pm interview, cracking the tech career, and careercup reflect his passion for teaching.
1. The Interview Process
	- no section title
		- algo and coding problems form largest components of interview process at most top tech comps
		- talk out loud throughout problem solving and explain thought process
		- interviewer might help, its fine. youre not doing poorly
		- interviewer gets gut feeling of you based on: 
			- analytical skills
				- needed help? optimal? length of time to solve? structure and tradeoffs?
			- coding skills
				- did you translate algo into code? clean and organized? did you think about potential errors?
			- technical knowledge/computer science fundamentals
				- strong foundation?
			- experience
				- built interesting/challenging projects? shown drive and initiative?
			- culture fit/communication skills
				- do you fit? did you communicate well?
		- weighting is different for every interviewer
	- Why?
		- its more important to understand the process and learn about it rather than try and change it
	- false negatives are acceptable
		- companies would rather let some good candidates go rather than hire a bad candidate that just did well in the interview
	- problem solving skills are valuable
		- solving these problems can indicate a good programmer
	- basic data structure and algo knowledge is useful
		- learning all these data structures up front is useful because you can't use what you dont know
		- knowledge of data structures indicates that the candidate has a solid foundation
	- whiteboards let you focus on what matters
		- the whiteboard lets you focus on the problem without worrying too much about minor errors
		- encourages communication and explaining thought process
	- but its not for everyone
		- it is what it is. play the game
	- how questions are selected
		- there is no set list. each interviewer selects their own and major companies tend to ask the same kinds
	- its all relative
		- interviewers assess you based on the other candidates
		- when the question is harder for you, its harder for everyone
		- its a feeling rather than numerical grade
	- i didnt hear back
		- usually theyre just waiting on feedback, ask recruiter politely if its been 3-5 days
	- can i reapply after getting rejected
		- yeah, just wait 6months to a year
